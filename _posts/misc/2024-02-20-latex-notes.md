# Here's some basic LaTex syntax that you may find helpful 

## Start writing LaTex 
To start writing in LaTex simply write dollar sign twice `$$ latex formula $$`

## Add `space` between two words   
To add `space` between two words simply add `\` between them or `\:`   
See more here in this stackoverflow answer -> [What commands are there for horizontal spacing? - TeX - LaTeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/74354)    
with back slash -> $ absoute\ return $   
without back slash -> $ absoute return $   

## Multiply symbol 
Just write `\times`    
$ a \times b $    

## Add space for multi-word variable     
just write `\space`     
**underscore won't work**   
or you can use `~` the squiggly symbol  
$ abosolute \space return = something \times something_else $   


## Make fraction 
just write `\frac{numerator}{denominator}`  
$ \frac{numerator}{denominator} $   

## Add big braces   
just write `\left( .... \right)`    
$ \left( \frac{AB}{CD} \right) $    
The keywords `left` and `right` need to be on the _left_ of the symbols

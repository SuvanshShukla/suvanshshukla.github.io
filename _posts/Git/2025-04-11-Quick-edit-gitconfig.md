# Quickly edit your `.gitconfig` file from anywhere

You can edit your `.gitconfig` file from anywhere very easily by usig a simple git global command.   
This **requires** you have git installed, otherwise what's the point?

Here's the command:

```bash
git config --global -e
```

This will open your `.gitconfig` in nano or vim (whatever you've set as your default git editor.    
The advantage of this command is that it can be run from anywhere!

Have fun!

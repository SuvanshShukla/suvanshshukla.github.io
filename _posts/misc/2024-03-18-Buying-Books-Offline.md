## Books 
aah, yes books. Those ostentatious little things with scribbles in them that so called intellectual people read. 
They're very common and very easy to get a hold of. They come in all shapes in sizes. From thick academic tomes to thin and long booklets.
One for every kind of reader. But finding the exact one for yourself is not as easy as it may seem. If like myself you are prone to the DNF affliction 
and can hardly finish even the smallest of books then this is a near herculean task, it certainly is for me. 

I (currently) only really like to read two types of books. Primarily Science-Fiction followed by a little bit of Fantasy. This shouldn't really come as a 
surprise since Fantasy is (currently among the most popular genre of books)[https://wordsrated.com/fantasy-book-sales-statistics/#:~:text=Fantasy%20book%20sales%20grew%20by%2045.3%25%20in%202021%20compared%20to%202020%2C%20which%20was%20the%20largest%20increase%20among%20all%20genres%20aside%20from%20graphic%20novels.]
But in India, Science-Fiction is hard to find (though, this statement is unfortunately from personal experience).


## Looking for Sci-Fi in India 
I like sci-fi, I was first introduced to sci-fi when I learned that the movie (Arrival (2016))[https://imdb.com/title/tt2543164] was based on a book by Ted Chiang, called "The Story of Your Life and Others". I searched it up and bought it from Amazon. 

Turned out that it was a short story from a collection of others. As I slowly read more and more, I was enthralled by each successive story and by the end I had resolved to read more sci-fi. After that the rocket took off and I read more books, from the latest hits, like "Project Hail Mary" to other stories like Foundation or Hyperion (All phenomenal books btw). 

But there soon came a point when I had gone through the most popular and easily accessible books and suddenly wanted to try buying books from offline sources, hopefully cheaper too. 

This however proved a much more difficult task then it let on, as it was hard to find good book stores even when you're in the NCR. And, even if I did find good book stores, they hardly ever had any sci-fi books. Plus they were definitely more expensive than Amazon! 

## Daryaganj 
It was here that I first heard of Daryaganj from a friend at work. I loved the idea of an open market where you could go, look for books then buy them by the Kilo! Yes you can buy books by weight in Daryaganj. 

Planning my trip, I got on the metro and found that I'd need to get off at the General Secretariat station of the violet line. From there, I'd go to the 3rd exit and simply keep walking straight and see the market on the left hand-side. 

What I had missed, was that the lane that Google showed me wasn't where the real market was at. The lane showed to me only had a few of the shops and they sold stationary along with books. I was not impressed, even though they did have books, none of them were what I was looking for.

It was a disappointment to say the least, and the experience on a whole was quite stale.  If like me you like to look at books alone and ponder a bit before committing to buying it then this wasn't market is not for you. Less than a book market, the Daryaganj market is more akin to a fish market. Just like how you can buy fish by their weight, you can buy books by their weight. Just like how you can get a fish butchered, you can get parts of a complete series  from a new boxset. 

The sellers even hawk and shout at you as if in a fish market, it's not the quite and comfy ambiance of a good bookstore. It is noisy, crowded and very very chaotic. Most hawkers don't know the books they're selling so asking for a specific author is hard, let alone asking if they have any sci-fi books, trust me I tried asking! 

While I was disheartened by not discovering what I was looking for I was surprised by the sheer amount of Manga on sale. Turns out Manga is getting pretty popular in India. If was still in school or college, I would have been drooling of the large boxset of completed Dragon Ball Z, but alas even I have grown up (just a little ! lol). 

## Finally...
Though I wouldn't say the trip was particularly successful, it wasn't a complete waste either. I now know how you're books will be treated if you sell them off to second hand dealers, and how it isn't worth it going to shop for books offline. Amazon though monstrous and terrifying, is unfortunately your best bet if you're looking for a very specific book. 

I also think it's better to give away your books to people you know rather than sell them off. At least the people you know might actually read them or at the very least take better care of them. 

All the best & godspeed reading!

WSL or Windows Subsystem for Linux basically allows you to emulate/run a Linux distro on your windows machine 

## Set up WSL 

1. go to `control panel`
2. go to `programs`
3. go to `turn windows features on or off`
4. you'll get a dialog box with various windows features you can toggle, scroll towards the bottom and you'll see `Windows Subsystem for Linux`
5. toggle it 
6. then you'll be asked to restart your computer, do it

## Installing a Distro of your choice 

1. before actually choosing a distro and installing it we need to verify if your WSL feature was turned on or not
2. open up cmd or powershell then enter `wsl --install`
3. If this displays a help message then that means your features have been turned on 
4. Otherwise this will enable features necessary to run WSL and start to download the default distro, [which is Ubuntu](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#:~:text=This%20command%20will%20enable%20the%20features%20necessary%20to%20run%20WSL%20and%20install%20the%20Ubuntu%20distribution%20of%20Linux.) 
5. To install a distro simply do `wsl --install -d <distro name>`, e.g. `wsl --install -d ubuntu`
6. After that your chosen distro should start downloading

## Set up Ubuntu username and password

After all that you'll have to enter a username and password for using on WSL.   
Just set whatever you, but it's best if you try to keep it in memory.   
You'll be asked to enter this password whenever you try to do something with `sudo`.

Here's a link on what to do if you forget your password for a linux distro - [what to do](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#:~:text=If%20you%20forgot%20the%20password%20for%20your%20Linux%20distribution%3A)

> [!NOTE]
> Some to note is that WSL 1 and 2 are slightly different and you have to do a couple of different things to upgrade from 1 to 2. 
> One thing I've noticed while working with WSL 1 is that it isn't supported by vite. So be careful when you work on a vite + reactjs project!

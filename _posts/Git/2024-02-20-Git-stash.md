## Git Stash 
- this command helps to temporarily save all the changes made 
- it can be reapplied upon need
- [Stack Overflow link on stashing changes of a specific file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5506339/how-can-i-git-stash-a-specific-file)   
- [Git SCM docs for git stash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash)    
- [practical guide to Git stash command](https://opensource.com/article/21/4/git-stash)    

## Basics of stash 
stash your changes :
```bash
git stash
```

re-apply last git stashed changes : 
```bash
git stash pop
```

shows stashed changes in a diff like way :
```bash
git stash show
```

saves stashed changes using a special keyword :
```bash
git stash save "keyword"
```

stashes the changes in a specific file, with stash_message :
```bash
git stash push -m stash_message "path to file"
```

view stashed changes in a git diff like manner (this only shows the latest stash)
```bash
git stash show --pretty
```

works a little like git stash pop but doesn't remove the stash entry from the stash list :
```bash 
 git stash apply
 git bash apply stash@{1}
```

this displays all the stashes you've done so far:
```bash
git stash list
```

this command stashes changes in patches  or chunks and you get to choose what is stashed and what isn't : 
```bash
git stash -p
```


## See only stashed file's file names 
To easily find only changed file names.
```bash
git diff --name-only stash@{0} master
```


## View file specific stats of a stash 
use `--stat` for view each stash's file specific information 
```shell 
git stash list --stat 
```


## stash a specific file only
If you do not want to specify a message with your stashed changes, pass the filename after a double-dash.

```
$ git stash -- filename.ext
```

If it's an untracked/new file, you will have to stage it first.

However, if you _do_ want to specify a message, use `push`.

```
git stash push -m "describe changes to filename.ext" filename.ext
```

Both methods work in git versions 2.13+ 

==file name along with extension comes after the message !== 

the following command worked for me : 
```bash 
git stash push -m "mandate status BSE response" -- src/main/java/com/gemini/clovek/service/SoapClient2.java
```
(it's all one line)
Here's another link that helped me - [Push files to stash | Git Cheat Sheet](https://gitcheatsheet.org/how-to/git-stash-push)
## View stash like a diff
According to this [great stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3579474) : 

`git stash show` will show you the files that changed in your most recent stash. You can add the `-p` option to show the diff.

```
git stash show -p
```

If the stash you are interested in is not the most recent one, then add the name of the stash to the end of the command:

```
git stash show -p stash@{2}
```

## Deleting a specific stash
```bash
git stash drop stash@{2}
```
 If a stash index is not provided it will delete a recently created stash that is `stash@{0}` 

## Deleting all stashes 
Be careful, but this can be done using `clear` 
```shell 
git stash clear 
```


## Save the stash contents to a text file 
```shell 
git stash show -p stash@{2} > stash.txt
```


## Viewing the date of when a stash was created 
Taken from [this useful stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15551618/get-the-creation-date-of-a-stash)  : 
```shell
git stash list --date=local 
```

it should print the output like this : 
```shell
stash@{Tue Oct 17 12:59:56 2023}: On minor-changes: nominee authentication of join holder added email and mobile number and declaration flags
stash@{Fri Sep 15 13:04:04 2023}: On minor-changes: portfolio valuation summary start changes
stash@{Fri Sep 15 10:40:19 2023}: On minor-changes: local dev env changes

```

you can also use `relative` to see how long ago a stash was created 

```shell
git stash list --date=relative 
``` 

or for YYYY-MM-DD format use `short` 

```shell
git stash list --date=short 
```

a more detailed view of a single stash can also give you this information 

```shell 
git show stash@{5} 
```

here's a highly formatted version with colors :

```shell 
git stash list --pretty=format:"%C(red)%h%C(reset) - %C(dim yellow)(%C(bold magenta)%gd%C(dim yellow))%C(reset) %<(70,trunc)%s %C(green)(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%C(reset)"
```


## Stash untracked files 
```bash
git stash save -u 
```
